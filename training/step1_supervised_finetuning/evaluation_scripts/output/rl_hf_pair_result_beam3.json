Mutual funds are typically actively managed, meaning the funds are managed by a professional fund manager who is making decisions on the investments in the fund. ETFs are typically passively managed, meaning the investments in the fund are tracked by an index or benchmark, with little to no decision making by the fund manager. \n\n2  When it comes to the benefits and drawbacks of investing in mutual funds and ETFs, some of the key differences to consider are the cost, liquidity, and risk factors. With mutual funds, you typically have higher ongoing cost due to the active management, but also have a generally easier and more liquid buying process. Conversely, ETFs tend to have lower ongoing costs but are less liquid and may have higher trading costs. Risk factors also vary between mutual funds and ETFs. Mutual funds often have a higher risk profile due to the actively managed nature, while ETFs follow the underlying benchmark, such as an index, and may have a lower risk profile.",

This type of mortgage typically has a lower interest rate but higher monthly payments. \n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a loan with an interest rate that can change periodically. ARM loans typically have lower interest rates and lower monthly payments than fixed-rate mortgages but can be more unpredictable in the future.\n\nFHA loans are offered by the Federal Housing Administration and are designed to help low to moderate-income borrowers obtain a mortgage. These loans have lower credit score and down payment requirements than other types of loans and typically offer more flexible terms.\n\nVA loans are designed for veterans and active duty military personnel. They require no down payment and have relatively low interest rates.\n\nJumbo loans are mortgages that exceed the maximum allowed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and typically require larger down payments and higher credit scores.\n\nA reverse mortgage is a loan available to homeowners aged 62 and older that allows them to receive payments from their home's equity.

My guess is that what's really most important is an environment that's comfortable.  So if the room is too hot, or the bed is too small, we need to find a way to adjust the temperature of the room, or the mattress, so that dreams are comfortable.  We also need to make sure the bed is clean, for example by going through the motions of putting on and off a mattress, but for example by folding the top sheet and top pillow case when we are at home.  These are all things that a human sleep specialist might find and help us to fix, if we're not getting good sleep.
